- **Computer Vision**
We develop novel vision architectures and training strategies for high-stakes visual recognition tasks — from lesion detection to surgical scene understanding — where performance and reliability are non-negotiable.
- **Clinical AI & Medical Imaging**
Our imaging research focuses on automated analysis of radiological, pathological, and ophthalmic images. We build AI pipelines that assist clinicians with diagnosis, triage, and treatment planning at scale.
- **Deep Learning & Machine Learning**
We investigate foundational deep learning methods including self-supervised learning, domain adaptation, and few-shot learning — tackling the core challenge of building robust models from limited labeled clinical data.
- **Patient Outcomes & Clinical Research**
We partner with clinicians to measure how AI tools affect real patient outcomes, workflow efficiency, and diagnostic accuracy — ensuring our research translates into meaningful clinical benefit.
- **Trustworthy AI in Healthcare**
We study explainability, uncertainty quantification, bias detection, and fairness in clinical AI system
